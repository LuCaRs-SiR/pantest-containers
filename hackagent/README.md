## What is HackAgent?

HackAgent is a comprehensive Python SDK and CLI designed to help security researchers, developers, and AI safety practitioners evaluate and strengthen the security of AI agents.



As AI agents become more powerful and autonomous, they face security challenges that traditional testing tools cannot address:

| Threat | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prompt Injection** | Malicious inputs that hijack agent behavior |
| **Jailbreaking** | Bypassing safety guardrails and content filters |
| **Goal Hijacking** | Manipulating agents to pursue unintended objectives |
| **Tool Misuse** | Exploiting agent capabilities for unauthorized actions |

HackAgent automates testing for these vulnerabilities using research-backed attack techniques, helping you identify and fix security issues before they are exploited.

## Architecture

HackAgent uses a modular pipeline to test agent robustness end-to-end.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Attack Engine** | Orchestrates attacks using AdvPrefix, AutoDAN-Turbo, PAIR, TAP, FlipAttack, BoN, h4rm3l, CipherChat, PAP, and Static Template |
| **Generator** | LLM role that creates adversarial prompts to test the target agent |
| **Judge** | LLM role that evaluates whether attacks bypass safety measures |
| **Target Agent** | Your AI agent under test across supported frameworks |
| **Datasets** | Pre-built benchmark presets plus custom HuggingFace/file datasets |

## Reporting

HackAgent supports both local and remote reporting.

- Local mode stores test results in SQLite and includes a built-in dashboard.
- Cloud mode syncs runs to the HackAgent remote platform when an API key is configured.

```bash
hackagent web
```

Access cloud reporting at [https://app.hackagent.dev](https://app.hackagent.dev).
